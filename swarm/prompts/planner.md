# Find an improvement or issue

Look through the swarm/PLAN.md file and the code base in general and find something to improve. Don't add any brand new features - just try to round out the features that are already in place. E.g. if something could be improved, or it's missing something. We're trying to get to a shippable MVP, don't need anything new, everything just needs to work. Don't duplicate what's already in ./swarm/todo/

# Write a feature file

Then plan out the feature and write it to ./swarm/todo/{feature-name}.pending.md

# Exit condition

If you fail to find an improvement, or if you've successfully written a single feature - exit immediately.
